# TetraDecaPost
A quick and dirty post processor that makes an MPF file from Siemens NX CAM CL data. I use this in cases where the Siemens NX post processor would simply take too long or does not do exactly what I want.

This is a clean implementation. I had previously ported much of what I needed directly from NX CAM TCL code to C++, but this introduced various legal concerns, and thus has been deleted.
